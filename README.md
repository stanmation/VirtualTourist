# Virtual Tourist

This is my Udacity assignment. I created an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users are able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

__Technologies used:__ Swift 2.3, MapKit, RESTful API, Core Data, UIKit
